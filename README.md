### Code

-   The current notebooks to reproduce the analyses are in the scripts folder.


### Data

-   The raw EEG data recorded from the EEG-notebooks are in the data folder. 

### Dependencies

-   Python. [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) should provide you with most of what you need. 
-   requirements.txt contains the packages allowing to recreate the environment (e.g. by conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt)
-   We thank the team from [eeg-notebooks](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks) for their fantastic work to democratize the cognitive neuroscience experiment.
